PHP Excel read/write abstraction layer, support [PhpSpreadSheet](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadSheet), [LibXL](https://github.com/iliaal/php_excel), [Spout](https://github.com/box/spout) and PHP `fputcsv`/`fgetcsv`

Targets to simplify server compatibility issue between Excel libraries and performance issue in huge files.

Ideal for simple-formatted but huge spreadsheet files such as reporting.

## Known Issues

- Spout reader driver output empty rows as SINGLE column (Upstream problem?)
- Spout do not support random read/write rows (Upstream limitation, Won't fix)
- Spout do not support formula (Upstream limitation, Won't fix)
- fputcsv driver ignores all ColumnType::* (File-type limitation, Won't fix)
